## About Me
I donâ€™t follow trendsâ€”I set standards. Cybersecurity, UI/UX, and AI arenâ€™t just fields I work in; theyâ€™re systems I understand, manipulate, and refine. Security isnâ€™t just about protectionâ€”itâ€™s about control. A well-designed interface isnâ€™t just aestheticâ€”itâ€™s calculated. My work is built on precision, execution, and dominance.
